ForLang project is an application that helps to study FOReign LANGuages. A feature of our application is that you
can learn several languages at the same time. At the moment, our application has the function of learning languages
by reading books and texts, and memorizing new words that the user can meet in the text, and then add them to the
dictionary to learn them through training.

User can translate a word they don't understand without leaving the application, and then add the translations they
find most useful to the memorization system, which makes the reading process fast and convenient. The user can also
track learning result, which will help make learning more effective for the user.

The purpose of creating this application is to simplify the studying of different foreign languages at the same time and
make learning convenient for people.
